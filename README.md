goc is a comprehensive coverage testing system for The Go Programming Language, especially for some complex scenarios，like system testing code coverage collection and
accurate testing.

> **Note:**
>
> This readme and related documentation are Work in Progress.

## Installation
To install goc tool, you need to install Go first (**version 1.11+ is required**), then:

```go get -u github.com/qiniu/goc```

## Examples
You can use goc tool in many scenarios.

### Code Coverage Collection for your Golang System Tests
Goc can collect code coverages at runtime for your long-run golang applications. To do that, normally just need three steps:

1. use `goc server` to start a service registry center:
    ```
    ➜  simple-go-server git:(master) ✗ goc server
    ```
2. use `goc build` to build the target service, and run the generated binary. Here let's take the [simple-go-server](https://github.com/CarlJi/simple-go-server) project as example:
    ```
    ➜  simple-go-server git:(master) ✗ goc build .
    ... // omit logs
    ➜  simple-go-server git:(master) ✗ ./simple-go-server  
    ```
3. use `goc profile` to get the code coverage profile of the started simple server above:
    ```
    ➜  simple-go-server git:(master) ✗ goc profile
    mode: atomic
    enricofoltran/simple-go-server/main.go:30.13,48.33 13 1
    enricofoltran/simple-go-server/main.go:48.33,50.3 1 0
    enricofoltran/simple-go-server/main.go:52.2,65.12 5 1
    enricofoltran/simple-go-server/main.go:65.12,74.46 7 1
    enricofoltran/simple-go-server/main.go:74.46,76.4 1 0
    ...   
    ```
    Enjoy, Have Fun!

## RoadMap
- [x] Support code coverage collection for system testing.
- [x] Support code coverage counters clear for the services under test at runtime.
- [ ] Support develop mode towards accurate testing.
- [ ] Support code coverage diff based on Pull Request.
- [ ] Optimize the performance costed by code coverage counters.
